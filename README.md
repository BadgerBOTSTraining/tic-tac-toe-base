# Tic Tac Toe Project

Create a program that simulates a game of Tic-Tac-Toe between two human players.


### The program should:
 - Show the board before or after each move.
 - Ask the player where they want to go on the board.
 - Update the board with the player's move.
 - Tell who the winner is after the game is over.

### Optional (If you finish early)
 - Make an option to play against a bot.
 - Create another small game (like connect 4).
